In the logs-app application I added a function to retrieve data
from an endpoint using RestTemplate because Iam using Spring boot

and in the URL request It was "http://pingpong-sve:2222/getCount" 

which is the name of the service and the port it listens on.

*Note: I added the two deployments into a namespace called ns-pong-output
