Project:v1.2

In this exercise I connected my spring boot backend application with
postgreSQL database to save the todos and I passed all the environment variables it needs from a configMap,
You can review how I did that in the application.properties file in the backend project.

I also separated each app's manifests in separate directories for better organization.
